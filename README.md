These are the graphing and analysis scripts for a manuscript in preparation for Global Ecology and Biogeography by Christine Rollinson & Margot Kaye.  The topic of the paper is comparing species distribution models that assume different causal relationships between climate and species distribution. 

These scripts were originally generated by C. Rollinson for her dissertation and are admittedly a mess.  In addition to the original, messy & poorly documented workflow, separate scripts will be added that contain organized versions of the analyses & figures that are present in the manuscript.
